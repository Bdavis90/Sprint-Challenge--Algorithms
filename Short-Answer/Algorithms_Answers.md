#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Tc is O(n) the algorithm will only loop the whole size of n

b) Tc is O(n log n) the algorithm will loop the while size of n for the first loop than the second one will loop in log n time

c) Tc is O(n) it calls recursivly only the size of n

## Exercise II

First you would want to go to the middle floor of the building and throw a egg off

If the egg breaks than you kno everything above that floor the egg will break

Then you go to the middle of the remaining floors and repeat the process

Runtime Complexity of this algorithm is O(log n)
